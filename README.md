Clickery is an AUTOGUI software designed to make it easier to use AUTOGUI without coding.

## Getting Started



To get started with Clickery, [download the Clickery zip](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/Clickery/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it , open it on any terminal (preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and execute the following command in the terminal:

```
py setup.py
```

This will install all the required libraries to run the project. Then, execute the following command to start the program:


```
py main.py
```


## Mode of Input

After running the program, you will be prompted to choose the mode of input.

### File Input

For file input, your JSON file must be formatted in the specified way in order to be read by the program. It is not recommended to write this file from scratch; it is always better to first record your actions through manual input and copy and paste them from `history.json` or `history.db` later. However, you can manually write a file following these guidelines if desired.

#### General Guidelines

Your file input must be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an action. Each dictionary may or may not contain an ID.


| Action                     | Syntax                                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MOVE CURSOR                | `{'move': {'x': 935, 'y': 697}}`                                  |
| LEFT CLICK                 | `{'l-click': 1}`                                                    |
| RIGHT CLICK                | `{'r-click': 1}`                                                    |
| DRAG CURSOR                | `{'drag': {'x': 1031, 'y': 955}}`                                  |
| ENTER TEXT                 | `{'write': 'Hello World'}`                                          |
| WAIT TIME                  | `{'sleep': 1}`                                                      |
| WAIT FOR IMAGE             | `{'image': 'C:/Users/images/image-to-search.png'}`                 |
| WAIT FOR KEY INPUT         | `{'wait_key': 1}`                                                   |
| INSERT KEY                 | `{'key': 'shift'}`                                                  |
| INSERT HOTKEY              | `{'hotkey': ['ctrl', 'C']}`                                         |
| TAKE A SCREENSHOT          | `{'screenshot': 'C:/Users/images/Screenshot.png'}/`                 | 


##### MOVE CURSOR

```{'move': {'x': 935, 'y': 697}}```

The key must be `move`, and the `x` and `y` positions must be specified as shown in the example. The top-left corner of the screen is the `(0,0)` region, with `x` increasing as you go right and `y` increasing as you go down.

##### LEFT CLICK

```{'l-click': 1}```

The key must be `l-click`, but the value can be anything, as it is ignored by the program.

##### RIGHT CLICK

```{'r-click': 1}```

The key must be `r-click`, but the value can be anything, as it is ignored by the program.

##### DRAG CURSOR

```{'drag': {'x': 1031, 'y': 955}}```

The key must be `drag`, and the `x` and `y` positions must be specified as shown in the example. The top-left corner of the screen is the `(0,0)` region, with `x` increasing going right and `y` increasing going down.

##### ENTER TEXT 
```{'write': 'Hello World'}```

The key must be `write` and the value must be the text you would like to write.

##### WAIT TIME
```{'sleep': 1}```

To pause the program for a specified amount of time, use the key `sleep` and specify the desired time in seconds as the value.

##### WAIT FOR IMAGE 
```{'image': 'C:/Users/images/image-to-search.png'}```

To pause the program until a specified image appears on the screen, use the key `image` and specify the file path of the image as the value.

##### WAIT FOR KEY INPUT
```{'wait_key': 1}```

To pause the program until the user presses a key on the keyboard, use the key `wait_key`. The value can be anything, as it is ignored by the program.

##### INSERT KEY 
```{'key': 'shift'}```

To insert a single key into the program, use the key `key` and specify the desired key in lowercase and without whitespace as the value.

##### INSERT HOTKEY
```{'hotkey': ['ctrl', 'C']}```

To insert a combination of keys as a hotkey, use the key `hotkey` and specify a list of the keys in lowercase as the value.

##### TAKE A SCREENSHOT
```{'screenshot': 'C:/Users/images/Screenshot.png'}```

To take a screenshot of the current screen, use the key `screenshot` and specify the desired file path and filename as the value.

### Example

```
[
  { "move": { "x": 1008, "y": 863 }, "id": 1 },
  { "l-click": 1, "id": 2 },
  { "r-click": 1, "id": 3 },
  { "drag": { "x": 1007, "y": 864 }, "id": 4 },
  { "write": "He110 W0r1D", "id": 5 },
  { "sleep": 3, "id": 6 },
  { "image": "C:/Users/images/image-to-search.png", "id": 7 },
  { "wait_key": "shift", "id": 8 },
  { "key": "shift", "id": 9 },
  { "hotkey": ["ctrl", "x"], "id": 10 },
  { "screenshot": "C:/Users/images/Screenshot.png", "id": 11 }
]

```

*Note: only json files are supported for file input*

# Manual Input

To record actions using manual input, follow these instructions:


| id | description         | call      |
|----|--------------------|-----------|
| 1  | MOVE CURSOR        | `1`       |
| 2  | LEFT CLICK         | `2`       |
| 3  | RIGHT CLICK        | `3`       |
| 4  | DRAG CURSOR        | `4`       |
| 5  | ENTER TEXT         | `5`       |
| 6  | WAIT TIME          | `6`       |
| 7  | WAIT FOR IMAGE     | `7`       |
| 8  | WAIT FOR KEY INPUT | `8`       |
| 9  | INSERT KEY         | `9`       |
| 10 | INSERT HOTKEY      | `0`       |
| 11 | DELETE LAST ACTION | `-`       |
| 12 | TAKE A SCREENSHOT  | `=`       |


#### MOVE CURSOR

To record the action of moving the cursor to a specific location, hover over the location and input `1`.

#### LEFT CLICK

To record a left click at the current cursor position, input `2`. It is best used in conjunction with the `MOVE CURSOR` or `WAIT FOR IMAGE` actions.

#### RIGHT CLICK

To record a right click at the current cursor position, input `3`. Like the `LEFT CLICK` action, it is most effective when used with `MOVE CURSOR` or `WAIT FOR IMAGE`.

#### DRAG CURSOR

To record the action of dragging the cursor to a specific location, hover over the location and input `4`. The cursor will click and hold at its current position, move to the specified location, and then release.

#### ENTER TEXT

To record the action of entering text, input `5` and enter the desired text in the dialogue box that appears.

#### WAIT TIME

To record a waiting period, input `6` and enter the number of seconds to wait.

#### WAIT FOR IMAGE

To record a waiting period until a specific image appears on screen, input `7` and select the location of the image. This action has several additional features:

- Automatically moves the cursor to the center of the image if found on screen
- Waits until the image appears on screen
- Can be used in conjunction with `LEFT CLICK` or `RIGHT CLICK` for additional functionality

#### WAIT FOR KEY INPUT

To record a waiting period until a specific key is pressed, input `8` and enter the desired key.

#### INSERT KEY

To record the action of inserting a specific key from the keyboard, input `9` and enter the desired key.

To insert multiple keys at once, use the `INSERT HOTKEY` action.

#### INSERT HOTKEY

To record the action of inserting multiple keys at once, input `0` and enter each key individually, then click `Submit`. This is useful for actions such as `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+W`.

#### DELETE LAST ACTION

To delete the last recorded action in manual input mode, input `-`. In the `Replace Action` section (after all actions have been recorded), this action will delete the element with the specified ID.

#### TAKE A SCREENSHOT

To take a screenshot and save it to a specified location, input `=`. Enter the desired save location in the dialogue box that appears.
  

# Post-Recording Actions

If you input `esc`, all actions up to that point will be saved in [`history.json`](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/CLICKERY/blob/main/assets/json/history.json). These actions can be further modified by:

## LOOP

Requested portions of the recorded actions can be repeated any number of times by entering the desired number of loops in the dialogue box that appears after you input the `ctrl` key.

## REPLACE

An action can be replaced with another one by entering the ID of the action to be replaced and the [call](guide.md#manual-input) of the action you would like to use as the replacement.

#### Tip:

*Combining Replacing and Looping allows you to insert actions into your recorded sequence.*

# Finalization

After recording and modifying the actions, they can be started by pressing the `space` key.

#### Things to Note:

- A started execution can be exited with `ctrl+c` (Keyboard Interrupt).
- It can also be exited by moving the cursor to the corner of the screen.
- Other methods commonly used for exiting a program can also be used.

# Saving the Input

Every successful execution from the last `reset.py` is saved in the [`assets/database/history.db`](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/CLICKERY/blob/main/assets/database/history.db) in the `history` table, while the last recorded action is saved in the [`assets/json/history.json`](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/CLICKERY/blob/main/assets/json/history.json). 


# Modifying Input Speed

The input speed for clicking, dragging, and typing can be modified through the configuration file located at [```sample/universal/config.py```](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/CLICKERY/blob/main/sample/universal/config.py).

# File Reference Guide

## setup.py

This Python file is responsible for downloading and installing all of the necessary libraries required to run the program successfully.

## reset.py

This Python file is used to clear various elements such as history, database, pycache files, and converted images, ensuring that the program is running optimally.

## requirements.txt

This file is utilized by `setup.py` to obtain a comprehensive list of the libraries required for the program to function correctly.

## main.py

This is the primary program file, which should only be executed after `setup.py` has been successfully run.

## sample

This directory contains a variety of subprogram files, including:

### helpers

These files are responsible for managing dialogue boxes, saving recorded input, and improving the clarity of dialogue boxes.

### post_record

These files handle functions such as `LOOP` and `REPLACE`

### pre_record

These files assist in the process of recording user requests.

### universal

This directory contains important data such as constant configurations and a list of possible user requests.

### core.py

This is the second main file and plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of the program.

# Configuration

The typing speed, clicking speed, and dragging speed for this project can be modified within the [```sample\universal\config.py```](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/CLICKERY/blob/main/sample/universal/config.py) file.

# Database

![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/sqlite-%2307405e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)

This project utilizes ```sqlite3``` as its database to store all successful executions starting from the last execution of the ```reset.py``` script. The schema for the database, which can be found at [```assets\database\history.db```](https://github.com/MZaFaRM/CLICKERY/blob/main/assets/database/history.db), is as follows:


```
CREATE TABLE history (
    actions_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    JSON TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (actions_id)
);
```


Should you wish to download ```sqlite3```, you may do so from the [official website](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). While downloading is not necessary for the proper functioning of the software, certain features may not be available if you choose not to do so.
